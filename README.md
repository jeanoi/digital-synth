# chord_creation
Initially, I was crafting waveforms using Python and then saving those waveforms to a WAV file for later playback. I found this process interesting and stored it in the "python_stuff" folder for future reference.

So a thought crossed my mind, what if I could create an open stream of communication with my sound hardware, enabling me to send and play waveforms in real-time? After some research, I decided to transition to C++ and, with the help of PulseAudio and additional tools, the project has been progressing quite well.
