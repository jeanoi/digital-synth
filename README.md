# chord_creation
Initially, I was crafting waveforms using Python and then saving those waveforms to a WAV file for later playback. I found this process interesting and stored it in the "python_stuff" folder for future reference.

So a thought crossed my mind, what if I could create an open stream of communication with my sound hardware, enabling me to send and play waveforms in real-time? So i've made the transition to c++ and maybe in 2080 i will finish this.
